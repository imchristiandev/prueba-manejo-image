# IT Globers Store Theme

IT Globers Store Theme is basic store front model based on the VTEX IO Store Framework.

It should be used only when you want to start a new store theme without any pre-set configurations. 

While Store Theme gives developers a ready-to-go default store front structure, the IT Globers Store Boilerplate Theme will enable you to build you store freely from scratch.

## Configuration

### Step 1 -  Basic setup

Access the VTEX IO [basic setup guide](https://vtex.io/docs/getting-started/build-stores-with-store-framework/1) and follow all the given steps. 

By the end of the setup, you should have the VTEX command line interface (Toolbelt) installed along with a developer workspace you can work in.

### Step 2 - Cloning the IT Globers Store Theme repository

[Use this template](https://github.com/itglobers/itglobers-store-theme/generate) repository to your local files to be able to effectively start working on it.

Then, access the repository's directory using your terminal. 

### Step 3 - Editing the `Manifest.json`

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the Minimum Boilerplate `manifest.json` file. 

Once you are in the file, you must replace the `vendor` and `account` values. `vendor` is the account name you are working on and `account` is anything you want to name your theme. For example:

```json
{
  "vendor": "itglobers",
  "name": "store-theme",
}
```

### Step 4 - Installing required apps

In order to use Store Framework and work on your store theme, it is needed to have both `vtex.store-sitemap` and `vtex.store` installed.

Run  `vtex list`  and check whether those apps are already installed. 

If they aren't, run the following command to install them: `vtex install vtex.store-sitemap vtex.store -f`

### Step 5 - Uninstalling any existing theme

By running `vtex list`,  you can verify if any theme is installed.

It is common to already have a `vtex.store-theme`  installed when you start the store's front development process. 

Therefore, if you find it in the app's list, copy its name and use it together with the command `vtex uninstall`. For example:

```json
vtex uninstall vtex.store-theme
```

### Step 6- Run and preview your store

Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command. 

If the process runs without any errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`. Then, run the `vtex browse` command to open a browser window having your linked store in it.

This will enable you to see the applied changes in real time, through the account and workspace in which you are working.
